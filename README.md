**This program demonstrates the concept of automated report generation by integrating with the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data and then creating a PDF report summarizing the weather for a specific city. It begins by making an API request using Pythonâ€™s requests library to retrieve key weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, weather description, and wind speed. The program ensures error handling by checking the status of the request and proceeding only if the data retrieval is successful. After extracting and organizing the data, the program uses the ReportLab library to automatically generate a PDF document, which includes the weather details along with the current date and time. This showcases how to automate the process of creating structured reports, a crucial skill in data-driven applications, where data needs to be presented in a readable and shareable format without manual intervention. Through this, we learn how to integrate APIs, process data, and use Python libraries to automate the generation of reports in various formats like PDF, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in data reporting.**
